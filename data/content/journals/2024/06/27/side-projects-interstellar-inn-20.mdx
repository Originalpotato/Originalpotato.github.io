In today's update, I've enhanced the UI for visitor details in Interstellar Inn.
After experiencing the limitations of working on a small laptop screen,
I decided to increase the font sizes for all tooltips and add outlines
to all text for better readability. These changes aim to provide
a more user-friendly and visually appealing interface. Stay tuned for more improvements!
