To be honest, as someone who learned coding primarily through tutorials and self-study,
looking at other #gamedev code and not understanding anything can be quite discouraging.
It's a reminder of the steep learning curve in game development and the complexity
behind every line of code. While I appreciate the shared knowledge and insights from
experienced developers, it often feels overwhelming and confusing. What the hell, right?
But I'll keep pushing forward, learning from every snippet and challenge.

Thanks to the community for sharing your workâ€”your expertise drives us all to improve,
even when it's tough to grasp at first.
