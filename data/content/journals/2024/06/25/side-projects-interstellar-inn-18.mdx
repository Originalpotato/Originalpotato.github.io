Setting a new milestone in my game development journey:
my aim is to launch Interstellar Inn before my
solo development hours hit the 10,000 mark.
The countdown begins now, and I’m determined to
bring this project to life within this timeframe.

Stay tuned for updates as I work towards this ambitious goal!
