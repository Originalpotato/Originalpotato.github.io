Ended up completely changing walls from object instances to
arrays and drawing them as tiles dynamically.
It was painful but the performance increase is worth it.

Back to good old 800+ FPS days! ðŸ˜Ž I wasn't expecting this much to be honest.
Obviously should have designed it like this in the first place...
Anyways, now I can build a huge hotel without worrying about
10000 bloody wall objects trying to draw sprites individually...
